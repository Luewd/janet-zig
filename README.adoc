Zig bindings for the {janet-lang}[Janet programming language].

== Status

This project is in an _alpha_ stage, for the following reasons:

 * Currently this may not build on Windows without adding system libraries to build.zig.
 * Building in release mode without specifying a generic target (non-default) causes a segfault on execution.
 * No API bindings exist yet, currently only a standalone interpreter can be built.

== License

`janet-zig` is made freely available under the terms of the link:LICENSE[BSD 0-Clause License].
Third-party contributions shall be licensed under the same terms unless explicitly stated otherwise.

NOTE: {janet-lang}[Janet] itself is licensed under the {janet-license}[MIT License].
